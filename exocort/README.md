# Exocort capturers and processors

Minimal runner that boots the enabled capture and processing services defined in the YAML config.

1. Install dependencies with `uv sync` from the `exocort` directory.
2. Adjust the YAML file to configure `capturer` and `processor`.
3. Run the CLI directly:
   ```bash
   uv run exocort
   ```
   The `exocort` command is the package entry point and starts the runner automatically.
If your config file lives somewhere else, pass it explicitly:
   ```bash
   uv run exocort --config /path/to/config.yaml
   ```

The processor watches the configured folder recursively with filesystem events, sends supported image files to OCR and audio files to transcription using LiteLLM-compatible endpoints, and stores a normalized JSON file in the configured output folder while preserving the relative directory structure.

Configuration layout
--------------------

The YAML is organized in two top-level sections:

- `capturer.audio`: audio capture settings and retention for raw audio files.
- `capturer.screen`: screenshot capture settings and retention for raw image files.
- `processor.ocr`: OCR endpoint settings, individual enable flag, and retention for processed OCR JSON artifacts.
- `processor.asr`: ASR endpoint settings, individual enable flag, and retention for processed ASR JSON artifacts.
- `processor.content_filter`: optional content filtering for OCR/ASR output.
- `processor.notes`: note generation settings.
- `processor.notes.system_prompt`: configurable system prompt for the notes agent.

Example:

```yaml
capturer:
  audio:
    enabled: true
    output_dir: ../tmp/raw/audio
    expired_in: 300
  screen:
    enabled: true
    output_dir: ../tmp/raw/screen
    expired_in: 60

processor:
  watch_dir: ../tmp/raw
  output_dir: ../tmp/processed
  ocr:
    enabled: true
    model: mistral/mistral-ocr-latest
    api_base: http://127.0.0.1:9093/v1
    api_key_env: LITELLM_API_KEY
    expired_in: 600
  asr:
    enabled: true
    model: openai/whisper
    api_base: http://127.0.0.1:9092/v1
    api_key_env: LITELLM_API_KEY
    expired_in: 600
  content_filter:
    enabled: true
    rules:
      - name: credentials
        keywords:
          - password
          - api key
          - token
        regexes:
          - '(?i)\\bsk-[a-z0-9]{20,}\\b'
          - '(?i)\\b(?:password|passcode|pin)\\s*[:=]\\s*\\S+'
  notes:
    enabled: true
    vault_dir: ../vault
    system_prompt: |
      You are the Exocort notes agent.
      Work only inside the vault using the available tools.
```

Retention with `expired_in`
---------------------------

Each `expired_in` value is expressed in seconds and must be `>= 0`, or `False` to keep the file forever.

- `capturer.audio.expired_in`: how long to keep each raw audio file after it has been successfully consumed by ASR.
- `capturer.screen.expired_in`: how long to keep each raw screenshot after it has been successfully consumed by OCR.
- `processor.content_filter`: if a rule matches OCR/ASR text, the normal processed JSON is not written, a `.sensitive.json` marker is stored without the extracted text, and the raw capture is deleted immediately to avoid reprocessing.

Behavior:

- `expired_in: 0` deletes the file immediately after the successful consumer finishes using it.
- `expired_in: 60` keeps it for 60 seconds after that successful use, then deletes it automatically.
- `expired_in: False` keeps the file permanently and never schedules deletion.
- Files are only scheduled for deletion after a successful handoff. If OCR, ASR, or notes fail, the corresponding file is kept.

Practical examples:

- Set `capturer.audio.expired_in: 0` if you want raw microphone captures to disappear as soon as transcription succeeds.
- Set `capturer.screen.expired_in: 300` if you want screenshots available for five more minutes after OCR.

Expected endpoint contracts
---------------------------

Transcription endpoints must expose `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` and accept `multipart/form-data`
with at least `file`, `model`, and optionally `language`, `prompt`, `response_format`,
`temperature`. The processor stores only:

```json
{
  "text": "transcribed text"
}
```

OCR endpoints must expose `POST /v1/ocr` and accept `multipart/form-data` with at least
`file` and `model`. The processor stores only:

```json
{
  "text": "recognized text"
}
```

LiteLLM still requires the `model` value to include a real provider prefix (e.g., `openai/…`, `mistral/…`)
even when pointing at an adhoc API base; otherwise the SDK raises `LLM Provider NOT provided`.
