# Notes Knowledge Principles

This document defines the intended behavior for Exocort's notes processor.

The goal is not to archive captures as summaries. The goal is to build a durable personal knowledge base: a wiki, an Obsidian-style vault, a second brain.

## What Good Notes Look Like

- Notes are organized by durable topics, concepts, tools, entities, projects, or areas of interest.
- Notes accumulate understanding over time instead of mirroring one batch or one session.
- Notes distill useful information into conclusions, takeaways, comparisons, definitions, workflows, and mental models.
- Notes prefer synthesis over transcription. Copy exact wording only when the wording itself is important.
- Notes should help future retrieval. A user should be able to open one note and quickly understand what is known about that topic.

## What To Avoid

- Do not create one note per batch, screenshot, audio clip, or browsing session.
- Do not produce diary, timeline, or session-log notes unless the user explicitly asks for chronology.
- Do not treat the output as a cleaned-up summary of "what was seen".
- Do not keep sections such as `Sources`, `References`, or `Recent Updates` as a default structure.
- Do not dump logs, UI chrome, repeated OCR fragments, or long unprocessed text blocks when the information can be synthesized.

## Organization Rules

- Choose note filenames from the subject, not from time or source.
- Split distinct themes into different notes when that improves clarity and later reuse.
- Merge new information into existing notes whenever the topic already exists.
- Prefer a few strong notes with clear scopes over many vague aggregate notes.
- Include a link when it is genuinely useful to preserve a canonical resource, benchmark, repo, paper, or action point.
- Prefer placing links inline near the relevant claim or example instead of collecting them in a generic link dump.
- Use `Open Questions` for missing understanding, contradictions, weak evidence, or things worth investigating next.

## Examples

- Reading several posts about OCR models should update notes such as `ocr.md`, `glm_ocr.md`, or another stable topic note, not a generic batch summary.
- Reading about Agent Skills should update `agent_skills.md` with what it is, what problems it solves, and what differentiates it.
- Seeing Exocort code, config, and runtime behavior should update `exocort_project.md` with a clearer model of the project, its architecture, and its operating loop.
